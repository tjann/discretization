AT1G04400, Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a \closed\ conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light  the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an \open\ conformation  resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus. - [ AT1G04400 / P: involved in response to water deprivation / Publication:501717502 ][ AT1G04400 / C: located in nucleus / Publication:1214 ][ AT1G04400 / P: involved in regulation of flower development / Publication:501720688 ][ AT1G04400 / P: involved in chromatin remodeling / Publication:501721286 ],10.15780495,9.98476336,9.999639689,9.8406091,9.71200918,9.44076697,10.41117138,10.30855887,10.28381842,10.29722318,9.757261322,10.06571731

AT1G19180, JAZ1 is a nuclear-localized protein involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ1 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein  presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. - [ AT1G19180 / F: has protein binding / Publication:501729990 ][ AT1G19180 / P: involved in response to water deprivation / Publication:501748728 ][ AT1G19180 / P: involved in systemic acquired resistance  salicylic acid mediated signaling pathway / Publication:501748728 ],7.925078209,8.168157678,9.464394692,10.22385215,9.281793211,4.174894103,8.498569109,7.530089901,8.032548392,8.33702623,8.400431303,10.13747077

AT1G42990, AtbZIP60 consists of a bZIP DNA binding domain followed by a putative transmembrane domain. GFP fusions containing the first 260 amino acids (AtbZIP60deltaC) are nuclear-localized. AtbZIP60 is upregulated by the addition of tunicamycin (ER stress response inductor)  DTT (inhibitor of disulfide bond formation) and azetin-2-carboxylate (proline analog perturbing protein structure). Upon ER stress the protein is proteolyzed and the soluble part is translocalized into the nucleus. AtbZIP60deltaC can activate the promoters of the ER chaperones BiP1  BiP2 and BiP3 and CNX1 and CNX2 via binding to the ER stress response element (ERSE) and the plant unfolded protein response element(P-UPRE). It can also activate its own transcription. - [ AT1G42990 / P: involved in abscisic acid mediated signaling pathway / Publication:501748728 ][ AT1G42990 / P: involved in endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response / Publication:501715166 ][ AT1G42990 / P: involved in response to chitin / Publication:501748728 ],7.479763575,7.591593088,7.958877494,8.368707822,7.424077536,6.620309754,7.660598201,7.401842547,8.294706103,8.278692634,8.12833637,8.095020345

AT2G21660, Encodes a small glycine-rich RNA binding protein that is part of a negative-feedback loop through which AtGRP7 regulates the circadian oscillations of its own transcript.  Gene expression is induced by cold. GRP7 appears to promote stomatal opening and reduce tolerance under salt and dehydration stress conditions  but  promotes stomatal closing and thereby increases stress tolerance under conditions of cold tolerance. Loss of function mutations have increased susceptibility to pathogens suggesting a role in mediating innate immune response. Mutants are also late flowering in a non-photoperiodic manner and are responsive to vernalization suggesting an interaction with the autonomous flowering pathway.   There is a reduction of mRNA export from the nucleus in grp7 mutants. GRP7:GFP fusion proteins can be found in the cytosol and nucleus.  A substrate of the type III effector HopU1 (mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase). - [ AT2G21660 / P: involved in Golgi organization / Publication:501748728 ][ AT2G21660 / F: functions in RNA binding / Communication:501714663 ][ AT2G21660 / P: involved in innate immune response / Publication:501727402 ][ AT2G21660.2 / C: located in chloroplast / Publication:501724486 ],12.91497493,12.95807805,12.1248915,11.98484325,12.3968534,9.99857816,13.06489168,13.06776009,12.16340593,12.58352817,8.226869846,12.66499607

AT2G33860, ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development  causing increases in perianth organ number  decreases in stamen number and anther formation  and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal  stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing  stamen formation  and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5  ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium  consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. - [ AT2G33860 / P: involved in organ morphogenesis / Publication:501748728 ][ AT2G33860 / F: has sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity / Publication:1345963 ][ AT2G33860 / F: functions in DNA binding / Publication:2927 ][ AT2G33860 / P: involved in pattern specification process / Publication:501748728 ],6.930306297,6.8806622,6.724807528,6.499525851,5.993525523,5.476000692,6.981025556,7.235434835,6.841979742,6.744157763,4.746510297,5.329659215

AT3G05530, Encodes RPT5a (Regulatory Particle 5a)  one of the six AAA-ATPases of the proteasome regulatory particle.  Essential for gametophyte development.  In Arabidopsis  the RPT5 subunit is encoded by two highly homologous genes  RPT5a and RPT5b.  RPT5a and RPT5b show accession-dependent functional redundancy.  In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality  indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession  a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte  whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants in Col background showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype. - [ AT3G05530 / C: located in proteasome regulatory particle  base subcomplex / Publication:501683232 ][ AT3G05530 / C: located in nucleus / Publication:1546228 ][ AT3G05530 / P: involved in cytoskeleton organization / Publication:501748728 ][ AT3G05530 / P: involved in proteasomal protein catabolic process / Publication:501748728 ],8.927731437,8.78745057,9.055398187,8.999919834,8.486073221,8.71096563,9.017855824,9.053824535,9.436258854,9.218121672,9.099252671,8.641345972

IBR3 is hypothesized to carry out the second step in a  &#946;-oxidation-like process of IBA metabolism in Arabidopsis.  Though its subcellular location has not been determined  IBR3 has a peroxisomal targeting  sequence and  two other putative IBA metabolic enzymes (IBR1 and IBR10)  can be found in this organelle.

AT3G60190, At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E  DRP1E  also known as EDR3  ADL4 and ADL1E  which is 624 amino acid residues long  has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1)  consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A  B  C  D  E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain  a central dynamin 2 domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED)  a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However  this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain  which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins  the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles  processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection. - [ AT3G60190 / P: involved in vesicle-mediated transport / Publication:501680481 ][ AT3G60190.1 / F: has GTP binding / AnalysisReference:501748310 ][ AT3G60190 / P: involved in defense response to fungus / Publication:501748728 ][ AT3G60190 / C: located in plasma membrane / Publication:501718909 ],8.32652667,8.472747103,8.684109301,8.546930191,8.092636255,7.748986763,8.440320335,8.35813548,9.16341979,8.885750311,8.130341909,8.390940673

Regulates light-dependent repression of hypocotyl elongation and flowering time via its 3'(2') 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase activity. - [ AT5G63980 / P: involved in photoperiodism  flowering / Publication:501729347 ][ AT5G63980.1 / C: located in mitochondrion / AnalysisReference:501750651 ][ AT5G63980 / P: involved in response to water deprivation / Publication:501680589 ][ AT5G63980.1 / C: located in chloroplast stroma / Publication:501735990 ],9.123643238,9.13835153,9.339736267,9.930910657,8.923868036,8.334171134,9.222225881,9.000820377,8.501140884,8.730956513,7.509817199,8.209288599
AT5G64740, Encodes a cellulose synthase isomer. CESA6 mutants have cellulose defect in the primary cell wall. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that CESA6  along with CESA1 and CESA3 are present in the same plasma membrane complex for cellulose biosynthesis. CESA2 and CESA5 are related to CESA6  having partially redundant roles.  As inferred from the null role of secondary wall-type CesAs  included in a set of five primary wall-type CesAs that may support trichome cell wall thickening. - [ AT5G64740 / P: involved in cortical microtubule organization / Publication:501725068 ][ AT5G64740 / C: located in plasma membrane / Publication:1521 ][ AT5G64740 / F: has cellulose synthase activity / Communication:1674989 ][ AT5G64740 / P: involved in cell wall organization / Publication:501748728 ],9.713952082,9.751200421,9.927515269,9.833015758,9.258781004,8.949604648,9.62436867,9.635921057,9.434778429,9.513696972,8.500919736,9.229162233
