GEDPROTOOLS - Gene Expression Data prePROcessing TOOLS
--------------------------------------------------



GEDPROTOOLS is a java swing application that allow visualizing and preprocessing Gene Expression Datasets. In particular, it focused on the discretization step involved in most qualitative knowledge inference approaches for Gene Expression Datasets. In this regard, it provides sixteen different discretization methods that can be tuned such as was published by the respective authors.
